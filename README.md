#### Welcome to the first pre-alpha version for CTemplar's frontend. This page will be updated often with new information. Your contributions are welcomed!

---

### Development
1. Modify the `apiUrl` in `src/app/app-store/config.ts` and point it to `https://api.ctemplar.com` to make it work if you're not running the backend locally.
2. To enable PUG compilation with the development server, you need to run `ng add ng-cli-pug-loader` every time you clone the project.
