            you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. We will not disclose your personal data including

        <p>
          <small>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted
            to us in a secure way. </small>
        </p>
        <p>
          <small>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.
