    <p>Your GPG 4096-bit key is being generated and encrypted with your desired password. By the way, you're also encrypting your password using the Argon2 (hash algorithm winner) so the original password won't be transferred to us.</p>
    <p>It can take from several seconds to several minutes, because your computer is doing this so we only receive the encrypted data generated by you.</p>
    <p>Only you know the password with access to unlock your PGP key, be careful as it CANNOT be recovered by any method.</p>
