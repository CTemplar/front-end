Looking around, it would seem the larger world was too busy to pay much attention,distracted by their own affairs or helpless to offer assistance. <br/> As just one man with limited capabilities, what could I do? Months went by as I pondered this question, finally realizing I must use my own strengths to wage a larger fight against the oppression I see in the world. As a result, I turned to technology—something I know and understand—to create a system of communication so strong and resilient I would trust it with my own life. <br/> <br/>Through this effort to protect communications through encryption, an entirely new service has emerged, one that will never sell out to corporate investors or be weakened by international agendas—CTemplar.",

Perhaps you are one of them. I believe we now find ourselves in need of a new Templar, one that can deliver protection against the ongoing invasion of our personal lives. <br/> Little by little, your privacy is being stolen away—as is mine—and the time is now to reclaim our rights, our freedoms, our anonymity, and to remember the strength of those who came before us, ready and willing to wield a weapon in their own defense.
